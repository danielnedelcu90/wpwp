Hi. I'm a webpack ready starter theme for WordPress called `wpwp`, or `whoop whoop`, if you like.

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to set things up manually, download `wpwp` from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the `wpwp` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `megatherium-is-awesome`), and then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for: `'wpwp'` and replace with: `'megatherium-is-awesome'`
2. Search for: `wpwp_` and replace with: `megatherium_is_awesome_`
3. Search for: `Text Domain: wpwp` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium-is-awesome` in `style.css`.
4. Search for: ` wpwp` and replace with: ` Megatherium_is_Awesome`
5. Search for: `wpwp-` and replace with: `megatherium-is-awesome-`

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css`, the links in `footer.php` with your own information and rename `_s.pot` from `languages` folder to use the theme's slug. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
